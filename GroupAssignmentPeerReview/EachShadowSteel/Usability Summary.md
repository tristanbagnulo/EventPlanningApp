# Usability Summary
Ten Usability Heuristics by Jakob Nielsen

| | Define | Implementation in application |
|  | ----------| ---------------------------|
|Visibility of system status|Key purpose is to provide communication and transparency between the user and the application, with an overall goal to allow for better decision making through increased information.  Hence, providing the user with appropriate and timely feedback to inform them about what is going on.| Epic Planners uses clear messages, loading status’ and completion signals to alert the user of the applications status throughout their usage. When administrators enter incorrect username and password, an error message occurs which gives the admin feedback that they have made a mistake and where it is. Likewise, when guests enter an incorrect quest access code, an error message will also appear. When the user saves an invitation PDF or changes to an event, a “saved” message occurs to inform them reassurance that their work has been correctly saved A completion signal of the users progress through the application allows them to keep track of their whereabouts when using Epic Planners. This will make sure they are kept informed about communications between the app and the user. |
|Match between system and the real world|The application should speak the users’ language, utilising real-world words, concepts and conventions. Hence, information appears in a logical and natural order to allow the user to find comfort in familiarity. This rule follows the notion that one should never make an assumption that their own understanding or interpretation of objects and words will match those of the users’.|The application uses simplified words and images to display outcomes throughout users' navigation of the app. Users are able to make changes to their work by following key common words that they would already know such as “save” and “edit”.  The user can log-out of the application by using the “log-out” button in the top right corner of the screen which they would be familiar with using in the real word ie. on social media websites.|   
|User control and freedom|It is essential to provide users with an option to rectify a mistake, hence, providing clearly marked undo, redo and exit points without requiring they go through an extensive dialogue.| The application enables user control and freedom, particularly during its log-in procedure. In this phase a user can re-enter and rectify a mistake made in their username, password or access code. Hence, identifying the issue and allowing the user to fix it to commence logging into the application. The construction of EpicPlanners places a key focus on user generated input, and hence, ensures they have the ability to make modifications. The user can therefore make edits to saved work e.g. upcoming events, to allow changes and new updates to be saved.|
|Error prevention|While error messages are essential, a good design will consider careful planning to prevent a problem from occurring and communicate errors in a clear, actionable and graceful manner. Executed by eliminating error-prone conditions or checking for errors before they are committed by the user. Categorised in two parts: slip errors and mistakes, an efficient design will consider the risk and impacts of both occurrences.| To mitigate errors and problems when using EpicPlanners, the application integrates different visual techniques to caution users of potential error-prone areas in the app. An asterisk is used to remind users of any compulsory input whilst optional text fields are also marked so that users know what is and is not absolutely necessary when entering information. The integration of the completion signal through the app allows the user to understand at all times where they are in their progression and when to save their updates. When guests input information, controllers have been made to ensure the data they provide fits the necessary qualities of data requested e.g. mobile numbers only include numbers and are 10 digits long. This mitigates input errors and ensures the quality of information is upheld.| 
|Aesthetic and minimalist design|Important elements will be diminished in relevance when irrelevant information is overtly displayed. In essence, every unit of extra information competes with the relevant information, overall diminishing its visibility.|Epic Planners integrates a cohesive, minimalistic design across all pages of the application to ensure the user can navigate through the app easily, with an aesthetically pleasing design. The application uses Sans Serif fonts, including Proxima Nova for their invitation PDF which is universally easy for users to read and comprehend.A minimalist design has been integrated throughout the entire application to simply show what is necessary on every page. This avoids confusing the user with redundant images or over-complex layouts. The application has been made with appropriately sized fonts and soft cool colours to make navigation through the app as easy and comfortable as possible.| 
|Consistency and standards|Ensures the platform follows connections through consistent actions, situations and words. Hence, there should be no questions by users as to whether different words or situations mean the same thing.| The application follows a consistent layout on each page to give the application a unified appearance as to not confuse users. Each page follows a uniform layout and design on every page with the EpicPlanners logo in the top left corner and menu bar inside the panel. Colour, font and size is consistent throughout application, creating an organised, clean appearance. The user also has the option to log-out using the ‘log-out’ button in the top right corner of the screen on every page. This ensures users will never be confused about how to exit the application.| 
|Flexibility and efficiency of use|The system can cater for both the experienced and inexperienced user, utilising shortcuts, advanced tools and frequent actions.|The application tries to cater for all users, no matter their level of experience with technology. Plain language and clear buttons have been used to assist inexperienced users to promote ease of  use.| 
|Recognition rather than recall|Focus on minimising the user’s memory load, as the user should not be required to remember information from one part of dialogue to another. Hence, the promotion of recognition over memory by making objects, actions and options visible to facilitate decisions.|EpicPlanners integrates the use of side-panel buttons and navigation flows to help the user go to any area of the application they are looking for, instead of having to recall locations. Quick navigation to items such as the invitation PDF and various events the user has upcoming helps facilitate their decision making of their schedules. Navigation buttons also allow the user to guide themselves through the app, giving them the freedom to return or move to wherever they please.| 
|Help and documentation|While it is better for a system to have the ability to be used without documentation, it is always necessary to provide helpful documents that are easy to find and search information.|The Read Me file of EpicPlanners includes the help and usability information the user will require when first directing themselves through the application. They will be able to search through the document to find any questions or concerns they have with the pages. The asterisks’ implemented next to compulsory information needed also helps the user understand what is needed from them or is simply optional.| 
|Help users recognise, diagnose and rover from errors|Plain language should be used to express an error message in the application, to specifically identify the problem and suggest a solution.|EpicPlanners includes specific error messages to clearly alert users where they have made an error. These messages have been created in plain language to help any user recognise the error made, no matter their technological experience. The inclusion of a completion signal allows the user to keep track of their progress within the application so that they can locate where in their progress they made a mistake.|
