#Project Management Summary

Collaboration and cohesiveness were the underlying factors that enabled our group to complete the task at hand. While the team recognised the importance of having clearly allocated roles within the group, it became apparent that we would gain most success by better understanding each other’s strengths and weaknesses, in order to best assign tasks. First and foremost, as a team we recognised the importance of developing a clear plan and outlook of how workload would be completed in the upcoming weeks towards the project deadline. Upon each member reading and gaining an in-depth understanding of the assignment brief, we created a list of tasks that would need to be completed and installed a Gantt Chant (Figure 1) and list of roles, as a visualisation tool to enable each member to clearly see task assignment.

However, as the project commenced the team recognised many areas of weakness proposed by the Gantt Chart, and instead decided to follow a more agile development practise. The task of creating wireframes and all FXML files, for example, was too vast to allocate to one team member solely. As well as, struggling to communicate with a team member no longer completing the project in the country. These pressing issues needed to be addressed and resolved quickly, and hence, the team utilised a scrum process framework. 

The implementation of an agile framework, allowed our team to better manage the project and the tasks at hand, working towards a well-defined goal. The first week of working together gave us clear insights as to which role would be best suited to particular individuals. By implementing a team leader or scrum master, Cecilia Chen and programming specialist Brandon Belikoff the team had greater direction moving forward. 

Having already created a product backlog of user-stories, the team had a distinct vision of what was needed to gain the end result. The next step was to prioritise these user stories and estimate workload for each, in release planning. The team carried out numerous short sprints, in which a set amount of work is completed in a designated timeframe acting as a short milestone to a submissible project. The remaining effort after each sprint was then updated and displayed in our team’s burndown chart, Figure 2 below. The daily scrum allowed for communication to flow between group members, acting as a fast-paced stand up meeting to address any issues encountered and list work that had been completed. These check-ins allowed us to stay on task throughout the sprint, as well as gain help from other group members where necessary.

By utilising the application GitHub, each team member was able to push their completed, or in-progress work to the group allowing us access to each other’s progress. While GitHub allowed us to share source code effectively, it was a challenge for some team members having not used the version control application before. We were however able to overcome this issue, and each team member effectively pushed their work onto the GitHub page throughout the project.

Through communication via Facebook Messenger, our groups collaboration remained constant throughout the duration of the project. Despite on-going communication issues with one team member, the use of sprints following an agile scrum methodology allowed us to complete each task of the brief given. While some tasks had to be re-addressed, for example, certain scenes created in SceneBuilder did not match specifications of the brief and were unable to be implemented into JavaFX, the use of sprints overall produced a functioning component of the final project. 

Overall, our team worked efficiently together and were hence able to produce a functioning product for submission. Our ability to adapt and overcome challenges was a pivotal aspect of our completion of the task, as well as our carefully planned and managed dynamic. The final result of our submission represents a well-considered product based on functionality and design, reflective of the team’s successful project management.
