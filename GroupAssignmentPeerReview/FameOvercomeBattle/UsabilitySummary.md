# Usability Summary

Universal Planning (UP) applies Nielson’s design principles to provide users with an easily navigable and operable system to manage events. 

### Nielson’s Ten Heuristics (1994)
1. **Visibility of User Status**

Our system aims to continually keep the user informed via text/labels so users are aware of the status of the system e.g. when admin are updating guest details and press the “Update Guest Details” button, a “Guest details updated” popup will let the user the action has been successfully processed. Another example of this is that once an RSVP entry has been made into the system, a message pops up saying “RSVP has been updated!” This quickly provides appropriate feedback to the user, helping with system transparency and communication.  

2. **Match Between System And The Real World**

Universal Planning has been designed for the average user, so information has been designed to have a  natural and logical flow (natural mapping), but not to the extent of using extreme skeuomorphism which may increase load time and impact the aesthetic of our program. A simple element that has been carefully considered to help users navigate around our platform comfortably without prior knowledge, are the rounded buttons named “Login” that resemble real world buttons and prompt the action of pressing. Essentially, our platform embodies flat design and minimalism over skeuomorphism, to improve efficiency in user experience. 

3. **Error Prevention**

To prevent errors from occuring, Universal Planning has implemented a system where users must confirm their action before the system fully commits to it. To reduce the chance of admins making typing errors when trying to update guest details, the access code textbox is designed to catch any of their errors i.e. as long as they enter in the correct alphanumeric digits, it will still be recognised by the system (despite different capitalisation for example).  


4. **User Control And Freedom**

An emergency exit is necessary in the situation where a user activates the wrong system functionality. Our platform has considered the importance of users having control over their own interaction with the system, so in the case where a user makes a mistake and clicks on the wrong page, we have a menu side bar that is always clearly visible to redirect users back to their desired page. This enables users to feel confident and comfortable in using our system, as they always have a way out from a mistake they may make. 

5. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**

Our overall aim for Universal Planning’s display was to reference the signal to noise ratio and focus on minimalism. “Signal” refers to relevant information, whereas “Noise” refers to irrelevant information. In order to carry out a high signal to noise ratio, we chose to not include unnecessary information such as instructions on how to get an access code (as a guest) or what an admin’s username and password would be on the platform itself, as all this information would be all communicated to users beforehand, hence enabling a less cluttered login page. 

6. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**

The program is relatively efficient as we have put thought into limiting the number of functions to maintain a clean and minimalist design whilst still catering to experienced and inexperienced users. As such, we have not implemented ‘power user’ options or advanced settings, but have worked instead to make sure features such as submitting once the ‘enter’ key is pressed on the keyboard are executed properly. 

7. **Help and Documentation**

Although it shouldn’t be necessary, in the case where the user requires additional support, Universal Planning has provided an assisting ReadMe markdown file that includes a specific, step-by-step set of instructions that helps with giving administrators and guests an overview of what functionalities they have in our system. Other than this, help and documentation is limited.

8. **Consistency and Standards**

Our consistent use of a San Serif font throughout the entire application helps with easy user readability. Furthermore, the blue and white colour palette used across the platform aids with our holistic approach to minimalism.

9. **Recognition Rather Than Recall**

The implementation of a sidebar menu allows for quick and easy navigation.The labels are relatively descriptive to satisfy recognition, not recall, but don't intrude on the design of our program due to its simplicity. 

10. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from Errors**

Our system incorporates descriptive error messages which clearly communicates to the user about what error has occurred and how to proceed. Within our system exists prompts that assist users through asking them to retry or the next steps they should take to recover from errors e.g. ‘Incorrect username or password.’
