# infs2605-20t1-FameOvercomeBattle
This is our Event Planning Application *Universal Planning*. For this application, we used JDK 11 with OpenJFX 11 as a GUI platform and SQLite as a data storage platform.

### Running the application

Please remember to **Clean** and **Build** before running the program.

### Significant Files in our Application 

1. *App.java* - Application’s Main Class.

2. *Database.java* - Contains all SQLite Connections, Statements and ResultSet functions that other classes can retrieve. 

3. *PageSwitcher.java* - Contains methods that allow for page switching, so other classes can easily retrieve from it.

Each .fxml is situated in the “Other Sources” file and defines the layout of the GUI (Graphical User Interface) screens using procedural code. Within these files, an “onAction” statement is produced linking the respective GUI with the controller class.

Controller classes define the behaviour of corresponding Views (.fxml). They are developed to link action elements with action handling methods. 


### How to use Universal Planning

For our application, we use **Admin ID** and **Username** interchangebly. So when a textfield asks to enter in Admin ID, please enter the admin username.

Same goes for **Guest ID** and **Access Code**.

**Administrator Use of UP:**
1. On first launch, the user will be greeted with the login screen, where they can input either an ‘Admin Login’ or ‘Guest Login’. 

2. The admin logs in with:

    *USERNAME: **admin***

    *PASSWORD: **password***

    The admin must enter the username and password in the text fields labelled on the left hand side of the screen and presses the “Login” button.

If their entered username and password is incorrect, an “Incorrect Username/Password” text will show up, indicating for them to try again.

3. If successful, the user will reach the Admin home page, where they are able to view all guests, events and invitation information, as well as “send out” invitations by entering in **AdminID**, **EventID** and **GuestID** and pressing “Submit”.

4. Admin users then navigate to the Events page via the menu sidebar, to create a new event or editing an existing one. They must comply with the correct formatting to submit data into the application i.e. input the Event Name,  Event Address and Event date/time need to be alphanumeric letters and Event date/time. The EventID will be auto generated by the system.

5. To edit an existing event, Admin users will need to enter in the existing EventID and make changes to either Event Name, Address or Date/Time accordingly. 

6. To edit or add new Guests, Admins can click on the Guests page via the menu sidebar, where they can select/enter guestID/AccessNo and change attributes such as email and phone number. Alternatively, an AccessCode for a new guest can be generated by inputting first name and last name into the register section and clicking ‘Get Access Code’.

7. The admin must **Log out** by **closing the application**. Please **Run** and **Build** before attempting to run the program again.



**Guest Use of UP**
1. The guest user logs in with previously communicated Access Code (from UP) into the labelled text fields on the right hand side of the login screen, then presses the “Login” button. 

2. If the user enters an incorrect access code, an error message will appear, informing the user that they have entered their access code incorrectly and need to try again. 

3. If successful, Guest users will be taken to their Home page, where they are able to view all the current events they are invited to and the corresponding details. To RSVP, they are required to enter in the exact EventID displayed in the table, enter a Y/N response and optionally, fill out the Dietary Requirements textfield. To submit all this into the application, they must click the “Confirm” button directly below.
