# Project Management Summary

A brief outline of our progression is included below: 

**Week 4**
- Assignment brief was released/finalised. 

**Week 5**
- 20/03/2020 - Initial group meeting to walk through assignment brief and discuss requirements, deadlines, and roles. 

- Team bonding experience to strengthen our group communication and morale in light of the transition online. 

**Week 6**
- Uncertainties arose on how to fully tackle the entire assignment and where to begin.

**Week 7**
- 30/03/2020 - Online group meeting to brainstorm ideas about design and what the application should look like (fulfilling the assignment requirements for admin and guest users). 
- Designing scene builder layout for login page + home page. 
- Setting initial tasks for each individual to work on.
- Communication over social media mainly in the form of social media, to understand who has made the most current changes to the code, for further work on it to be done by pulling the most current version from the repository. 

**Week 8**
- 9/04/2020 - Group meeting to brainstorm use cases for basic requirements of the program. 
- Working on designing database and pages on scenebuilder.
- Completed implementation of the SQLite Database, adding all necessary tables (Admin, Events, Guests, Invitations).

**Week 9**
- 17/04/2020 - Redesigned scene builder layouts.

**Week 10**
- 20/04/2020 - Assignment Due on Monday 1pm.

As documented in our timeline, brainstorming was done collectively as a group to understand the goals and functionalities we were trying to achieve from the assignment. The initial group meeting was effective in getting everyone started on the right note, however, attempts at goal setting were ultimately unsuccessful in the first few weeks as they were often unclear and did not have a set deadline. We soon adopted a SMART goal approach - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely, which significantly helped with achievement of the smaller, more time appropriate goals; one of our more helpful practices. The less helpful practices included not prioritising certain significant tasks that needed to be done first (due to poor understanding of the brief), letting uncertainty get in the way of starting the project etc. As a result of this, we found ourselves wasting time trying to rework and finesse the basic requirements. 

Version control was achieved via GitHub, a collective repository which enabled members to easily update the code files on our respective devices through ‘pushing’ i.e. committing the updated changes made locally, and ‘pulling’ the changes i.e. retrieve the changes made to the code file. 

It also acts as a safety net as each commit to the repository can be reverted back to at any time should we make a mistake. By specifically naming each “push” made to GitHub, this allows each team member to keep track of progress.
Issues arose when multiple members would work on the code without informing each other, resulting in a conflict error as GitHub recognises that the history of the newer file did not include the history of the older one.
