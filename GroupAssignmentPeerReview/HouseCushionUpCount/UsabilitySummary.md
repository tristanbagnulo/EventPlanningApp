**Usability Summary**

When designing our software application, we knew that we needed to make it appealing to view and use, for the users. This we decided collectively that we needed to use Nielsen’s ten heuristics in order to have a much more interesting, and appealing user experience. The ten heuristics include :
1. Visibility of System Status
1. User control and freedom
1. Aesthetic and minimalist design
1. Flexibility and efficiency of use
1. Help and documentation
1. Match between system and real world
1. Error preventions
1. Consistency and standards
1. Recognition rather than recall,
1. Help users recognize diagnose and recover from errors.

As the user logs into our application, they will either receive a message saying, “successfully logged in,” if the username and password are correct, or “Incorrect username/password,” if their login details are not recognised, showing the **visibility of system status** and it helps users **recognise, and diagnose errors**. We were able to utilise an **aesthetic and minimal** design that utilised the same three-tone colour palette, which was light pink, floral white and black/grey. This meant that users were able to navigate through our application, without the worry of clutter or confusion. Our colour palette was also very **consistent**, as were our fonts, which we used a san-serif font. We also were able to achieve **recognition rather than recall**, by making sure we clearly named each button, so that users wouldn’t have to remember how to user our interface.  For **error preventions** and **help and documentation**, we used dialogue’s and clear headings, to make sure that users were able to use our system, with ease. If they did anything that the system didn’t recognise or understand, the system would not continue, or ignore that specific action. Users were also able to exit the program whenever they felt like, or to go back to another screen , giving the **user control and freedom** and **flexibility**.
