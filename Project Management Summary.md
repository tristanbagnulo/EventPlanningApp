# Project Management Summary

This project management summary briefly outlines how our team managed the progression of tasks and the sharing of source code
using the version control software, GitHub.

## Task allocation

Soon after the assignment task was sent out our team had a group call. During this group call we created a Trello page for us 
each to follow to see our deliverables.

Additionally, we scheduled group meetings across a few weeks and used out excess time during tutorials to discuss the project.

## How we solved problems

If an individual team member encountered a problem or was unable to implement a certain function in Java they would ask for and
receive support during our group meetings. To show and view their problems and solutions, group members would share their 
screens across the Blackboard Collaborate session or via Messenger.

## Time management

We were pressed for time towards the end of the assignment. This may have been due to factors such as not continuously setting
responsibilities and due dates for specific tasks.  

## Sharing our code

As aforementioned, our team members worked on the same source code files using the group programming tool, GitHub. Here each member
had access to the same repository and was able to see other's changes and add their own changes to the code. We each maintained 
the operational rule, **Pull, Add, Commit, Push** which Blair adamantly recommend. The rule decreased the likelihood that our code 
would be overwritten or that the individual's local changes would conflict with other's changes. 

The rule means that before we could add changes we needed to pull changes from the document (this
way a team member has the most recent code from their team members); immediately after making changes we needed to commit those changes
and push them to the shared repository.
