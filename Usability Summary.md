# Usabilitiy Summary

## Executive Summary

This Usability Summary explains and shows how our application applies design princicples from 
Nielsen's (1994) 10 heuristics for software design.

| Number | Heuristic | How we apply this |
------ | --------- | -----------
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | We gives users feedback about what is happening in the background of our program in a number of places. These are: <ul><li>When creating a guest the Admin is shown the guest's access code which is automatically generated.</li><li>When creating/deleting a guest, the Admin is able to see the new entry in the database immediately in the table below.</li><li>When creating an event, the new event is immediately displayed on the events table</li></ul> |
