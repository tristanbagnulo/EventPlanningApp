# Usabilitiy Summary

## Executive Summary

This Usability Summary explains and shows how our application applies design princicples from 
Nielsen's (1994) 10 heuristics for software design.

| Number | Heuristic | How we apply this |
------ | --------- | -----------
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | We gives users feedback about what is happening in the background of our program in a number of places. These are: 
1. When the creating a guest the Admin is shown the guest's access code which is automatically generated. 
2. When creating/deleting a guest, the Admin is able to see the new entry in the database immediately in the table below. 
3. When creating an event, the new event is immediately displayed on the events table. |
